    "\n",
    "• After performing EDA, I found out that words and tags are seperated by '\\t' delimiters. And the lines are seperated by '\\n'.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The data was pre-processed 2 times to fit 2 different model architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The first model uses transfer learning on the \"en_core_web_sm\" model (a CNN model from the spaCy library).\n",
    "\n",
    "• The evaluvation metrics used in the spacy model are MAE, precision, recall and f1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The loss was brought down to 931.53. Since this is a simple model, the metrics are not comparable to the sophisticated ELMo     model.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The second model uses transfer learning on the ELMo model. It is a well-known Bi-directional language model trained on a billion   word dataset. I have added LSTM units to the same model to tailor our NER problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The evaluvation metrics used in the ELMo model are MSE, precision, recall and f1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The loss and the accuracy for this model are 0.0467 and 0.9871.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Clearly the ELMo model performs better due to it's complexity.\n",
    "\n",
